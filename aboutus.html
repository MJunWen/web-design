        This website sells various types of electronics.
        It allows consumers to browse through different types of electronics that
        we are selling and users can select individual products to view the details 
        of the product. The website has a shopping cart added so that users can purchase 
        multiple products in one transaction. Users can also track what they have added to 
        the shopping cart so far and the total price of the goods they have added to the 
        shopping cart. There is also a payment system that can consider actions to take if 
        the payment is successful or unsuccessful. If the payment is successful, the 
        website acknowledges the order and updates the customer on the status of the order via email.
